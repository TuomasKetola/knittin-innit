Small app for designing patterns for knitting jumpes

## Idea
With jumper pattern design there are a few different things one must take into account.

For Example:

* Where should the number of stitches be reduced to get the shape right?
* Does the repeated pattern match across the jumper or is there a cross over?
* What size repeating patterns are available at each point of the jumper
* What colors work together?

The purpose of this web app is to make solving these issues easy, whilst ensuring that
the integrity of the pattern and the design.

##Â Future plans
Currently the app is best used by coping the size and stitch deduction coordinates from an
exsisting model. It would be great to have an option where one can simply choose a yarn thickness
and a jumper size and the program would do the rest.

An English version might be good...
